A Javascript Artificial Neural Network

## phase 1

Arithmetics? Supervised classification? Is number x in set y?
A perceptron learns to perform a binary NAND function
on inputs x_1 \, and x_2 \,.


## phase 2

Recognize squares and circles (pattern recog.)


## phase 3

OCR

## Concept

It might be a good idea to start with visualisation: the supernode should run an admin dashboard (web interface).

A distributed NN can be made with serviceworkers (even multiple per node, i.e. browser) bound with WebRTC P2P (PeerJS).

Functional reactive code is optimal for streams of code. NNs provide a stream representing the calculation of the nodes.

Later on it might be an improvement to switch from Javascript/ES to WebAssembly.
